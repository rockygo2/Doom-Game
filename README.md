The engine type it uses is a 3D raycaster that uses blocks in order to measure distance

## CONTROLS

D : turn right

UP ARROW: move forwards

DOWN ARROW: move backwards

LEFT ARROW: move left

RIGHT ARROW: move right

SPACE : shoot

## Objective
find and collect all the keys

## Enemies

Approach you to blow up

## Advice
The purple path directly infront of the player is a bit difficult to start with choose any of the other paths to learn the game
Also i had no time to implement a game menu so the application needs to be restarted after a win/loss :(

run the program usin ./gradlew run
